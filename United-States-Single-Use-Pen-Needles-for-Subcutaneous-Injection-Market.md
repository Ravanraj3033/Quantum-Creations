Furthermore, medical institutions benefit from bulk purchasing and partnerships with manufacturers to ensure a steady supply of medical-grade needles.</p> <p>Medical institutions also see a growing preference for devices that promote safety and minimize the risk of needle-stick injuries for healthcare workers. As a result, pen needles designed with safety features like retractable mechanisms and safety shields are increasingly in demand. Additionally, medical institutions are adopting more efficient injection techniques that reduce the number of required injections, helping improve patient comfort and treatment outcomes. The demand for these needles continues to rise as the healthcare industry strives for greater efficiency, cost reduction, and patient safety across various therapeutic areas.</p> <h3>Others</h3> <p>The 'Others' segment includes various applications outside of home use and medical institutions. These may involve subcutaneous injections in non-traditional settings such as long-term care facilities, specialty clinics, and rehabilitation centers. This category is relatively diverse and may encompass both self-administered and healthcare provider-administered injections, often related to specific therapeutic needs. Although this segment is smaller compared to home use and medical institutions, it still represents an important part of the market as healthcare systems expand and new treatment options become more available to specialized patient groups.</p> <p>This segment is also seeing growth due to the increased use of biologics and personalized medicine, which often require subcutaneous injections in various healthcare settings. Furthermore, the development of mobile healthcare technologies and the growing acceptance of telemedicine have helped facilitate the adoption of pen needles across these alternative care environments. The segment's growth potential remains strong, particularly in regions with aging populations or increasing incidences of chronic conditions that require regular injections outside of traditional hospital or home settings.</p> <h2>Key Trends in the Market</h2> <p>The United States single-use pen needles for subcutaneous injection market is undergoing several notable trends, including innovations in needle design, a growing preference for patient-friendly solutions, and the shift towards home care.
